# Important note:
The submission on gradescope is the same as the one hosted on firebase with the only difference that the main page is called crud.html instead of index.html.
This is to avoid to rename the main page on firebase and at the same time satisfy the naming on gradescope.
In this way I mantained the mainpage "index.html" (as the demo video shows).
The link to the solution goes to another website that basically hosts HW4 and moreover has a link to the HW5 firebase website (cse134b-xmaswishlist.firebaseapp.com).
